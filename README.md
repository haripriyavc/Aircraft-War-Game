# Python Alarm Clock

## Overview

The Python Alarm Clock is a simple console-based application that allows users to set and manage alarms. It's a convenient way to wake up on time or set reminders for important tasks.

Key features of the alarm clock include:

- Set multiple alarms with custom labels.
- Specify the time for each alarm in a 24-hour format.
- Sound alarms with a customizable audio file.
- Snooze functionality to delay alarms.
- View and manage active alarms.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- A working speaker or headphones to hear the alarm sound.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/haripriyavc/python-alarm-clock.git


## Usage
To set a new alarm, follow the prompts to specify the alarm time, label, and sound file.
Active alarms will trigger at the set time, playing the specified sound.
When an alarm sounds, you can choose to snooze it or stop it entirely.
Use the menu options to view, edit, or delete existing alarms.

## Customization
You can customize the alarm clock by modifying the following:

Alarm Sound: Replace the default alarm.wav file with your preferred alarm sound. Ensure the file is in WAV format.
Snooze Time: Adjust the snooze duration by changing the snooze_duration variable in the alarm_clock.py script.
Time Format: The clock displays time in a 24-hour format. You can modify this by changing the time_format variable in the script.
